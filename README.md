# PrettySheep
Port of "PrettySheep" from MSX for the ZX Spectrum

This is a little game I created for the ZX Spectrum to test the [GuSprites](https://github.com/gusmanb/GuSprites) library for [Boriel Basic](https://zxbasic.readthedocs.io/en/docs/)

If you want to compile the solution you can do it manually using zxbc or use [SpectNetIDE](https://dotneteer.github.io/spectnetide/) for Visual Studio.

Use as you wish, and if you play it I hope you have fun!
